# PIMSHOE

PIMSHOE is a pricing and inventory management system designed by Tyler Hiu, Joe Kriviski and April Morrison

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
You will require an AWS EC2 instance, a AWS RDS instance, 
and MYSQL Workbench to properly get this program 
running and properly alter aspects of this program.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Only continue if you have properly set up AWS and RDS instances:

```
If you have completed the set up of RDS and EC2, continue to step 2
```

2. EC2

```
For this program to run correctly on your EC2 instance, ensure 
that you have installed apache and php on your EC2. PIMSHOE will _NOT_ run without 
these two things installed. 
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
